# Travelling Adventure
#### Brief description of application
To find a place to travell to in holiday event to go for a vacation is not easy since going to certain place without knowing the place is not agood idea since you cant now what will happen or you dont even know the place how it looks. Therefore getting lost, tired and many more disvantange is so easy.

To solve this problem, I decide to create a travelling adventure app that helps people search for the best place to travel and also can familliars themselve with the place by view the image of the place and also be able to see the reviews of that place before the decide.

## Technologies Used
* React - it was used to design, structure and add content to the web pages
* Ruby on rails - it was used to create the backend part of the application


## Installation
* Fork the repo and clone it on your machine using  the following command in your terminal:
  <br/> 
  `git clone [<path to  repo>](https://github.com/sharon-debug/adventure-frontend)`
* Navgiate to the cloned repo
  <br/>
  `cd /adventure-frontend` 
*  Open the cloned repo on your visual studio by using this command:
   <br/>
  ` code . `
*  Install dependecies
   <br/>
  `npm install`
* Install react-router-dom
  <br/>
  `npm i react-router-dom`
* Run server
  <br/>
  `npm run server`
* Start Project
  <br/>

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
